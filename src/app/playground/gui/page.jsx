                    “From Phonetic Alphabet to Printing: Myths for The Open Society ” would illustrate the adrift living situation of life in the form of digital media through the visual language of printed type. Using typography as the symbolism of human civilization, the project strives to give a re ection on our visual-dominance culture.

                    In the book "El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan” （The Garden of Forking Paths), Jorge Luis Borges mentions Ts'ui Pên - the Chinese literati who wanted to write a vast and intricate novel and construct an equally vast and intricate labyrinth "in which all men would lose their way." The labyrinth which contains all the possibilities symbolizes the book and the words. This delicate symbolism connects to the symbolic properties of the words and characters. In fact, every word and font has its history: a stroke that may contain the unexpected.

                    However, the overuse of emojis and memes for expressions nowadays dictates our senses rather than the glyphs and typographies. The phenomenon suggests that urbanizers who are exposed too much to online life may constantly su er from the scarcity of our expression in recent decades, that is, hard to nd the right “word” to depict our feelings. In contrast to these ignorances of the importance of the words, " our experience and of mental outlook and expression have been modi ed, rst by the phonetic alphabet and then by printing.”(Gutenburg Galaxy xii), words largely shape the states of our lives, as people use them to store and convert experiences. Under the circumstances that the words are largely ignored because that media technology has replaced its place in the expression area, there’s a necessity to bring the words back to our vision again.

                    Also, as mentioned in “The Gutenberg Galaxy”, our visual - dominance culture and written words would bring people into closed societies. And through epigraph could we move to the open society, as it helps us to acquire haptic harmony and balance di erent sensations. Inspired by his observations, I decided to show the history of language and a re ection on our visual dominance dilemma in "From Phonetic Alphabet to Printing: Missing for The Open Society".

                    There are 3 storylines in my animation: the evolution of language, the transition of human perception, and how humans perceive viruses. According to “The Gutenberg Galaxy”, our language transforms from hieroglyphs to epigraphs, and our dominant sensory follows this transformation, changing from auditory to visual. I use our perception of the virus as an example: we used to rely on oral experience to feel it, rather than observe it under an electron microscope.

              <TextSplitter text={`
                    To link the three storylines together, I arranged di erent words and typographies and explained the evolution of language with subtitles. After “Then we have letters…”, the “write” in cuneiform appears, signaling the gradual replacement of pictographs by epigraphs. At the same time, I also associate the virus and the text in variable ways. For example, the transformation of the word "CAT" at the beginning of the lm is not only an interpretation of the unstable and changeable nature of the spoken language but also represents the mutation of the base pairs. And when the yellow fever cells are being observed, the “看” (look) also moves.

                    Despite Marshall McLuhan's optimism that the epigraphic and electronic age will lead us to an open world, I don't think individualism has been stretched any further than before: especially after COVID-19. I nd that our visual cultures, such as the news, still restrict our thinking at all times. Therefore, I rethink our cognition ways in the electronic age: it is still likely that our extension of organs will in turn de ne the way we experience, as we rely on them to store and transform experiences. In this case, I put “ How we record, how we recognize” at the end of the animation as a warning about our age.

                                 With this non-linear narration and abstract glyphs, I hope to make people aware that every word and typography is beautiful and meaningful. And how largely the linguistic culture determines our cognitive style. We should reconsider how we perceive and in which way our perception inuences our thoughts. This way, we could strive for an individualized life, that is, the state of an open society.

                    Despite the fact that many expressions have been tried in the process, such as trying to tell the whole story in a science ction way and thinking about the possibility of adding physical devices. The completion of the whole animation is not satisfying: there are still problems with the transition of theimages, and it may still be di cult for rst-time viewers to understand the focus of the animation on the shift of the dominant senses.

                    Technically, I have a better understanding of the elements of good animation, the movement and the pace of the videos, and the smooth transitions between di erent scenes. Firstly, A good-looking animation needs to have several impactful images and beautifully-placed shots, and a sense of continuity. It also needs a complete storyline so that the audience could understand the stories more readily. Secondly, arranging the dynamics of the work is important to the completion of a story: there needs to be a beginning, a climax, and an end. The appearance and transitions of the images need to be paced. Besides, the transitions of animation are the key for the story to move smoothly. A suitable transition will make the whole story properly tied up. Lastly, the appearance of each element should be necessary.

                    I also accumulate more ideas about curation, I think it's worth thinking about whether multiple media help is necessary. In making the work, I tried to blend animation with other media, such as sculpture/AR, but a simple medium may be easier to focus on, and too much interaction of medium. How to show the theme, is the key to the ways of presentation .
